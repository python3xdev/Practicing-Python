'''
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list
of all the divisors of that number.

(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly 
into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

num = int(input("Enter a number:\n"))

for i in range(1, num + 1):
	if num % i == 0:
		results.append(i)

print(results)
